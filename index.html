                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    <img src="assets/pic1.png" alt="Pic"> Call me Ishmael. Some years ago- never mind how long precisely- having little or no money in my purse, and
                    nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part
                    of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find
                    myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find
                    myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet;
                    and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle
                    to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off- then,
                    I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.</p>
